# Unknown / Undetermined Items

1.  **Build Configuration**: No `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, or `webpack.config.js` was found. The project appears to be a raw source dump intended for a specific runtime environment (like an online coding playground) or uses a hidden build process.
2.  **Local Asset Files**: No local images (PNG/JPG/SVG) were found in a `public/` or `assets/` folder. All icons seem to be inline SVGs within the React components.
3.  **Test Suite**: No `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.ts` files were found. It is assumed no automated testing exists.
4.  **Linting/Formatting Rules**: No `.eslintrc` or `.prettierrc` found.
5.  **Environment Variables**: No `.env` files found (expected for a purely client-side local app, but noteworthy).
