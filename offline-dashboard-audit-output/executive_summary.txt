EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: STUDYOS AUDIT

**Overview**
Studyos is a feature-rich, single-page application (SPA) functioning as a comprehensive student dashboard. It demonstrates high architectural quality for a serverless application, utilizing a robust combination of `localStorage` for relational data and `IndexedDB` for file storage (blobs). The UI is modern, responsive, and highly interactive.

**Key Findings**
1.  **Architecture:** The app follows a Context-based state management pattern (`AppContext`) with custom hooks for persistence. It is effectively a "local cloud" OS.
2.  **Offline Capability:** While the *logic* is offline-capable, the *runtime* relies on external CDNs (Tailwind, React, Fonts). If the user loses internet access before these assets are cached, the app will fail to load.
3.  **Feature Set:** The application is surprisingly complete, covering Academics, Finance, Task Management (Kanban), and Wellbeing (Focus/Journal) with deep integration between modules (e.g., files attached to courses/tasks).
4.  **Security:** Input sanitization is missing for Rich Text components (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), posing a self-XSS risk if malicious data is imported.
5.  **PWA Status:** Incomplete. `manifest.json` and Service Workers are missing, preventing it from being installed as a true desktop-class application.

**Top 5 Recommendations**
1.  **Remove CDN Dependencies:** Migrate to a local build system (e.g., Vite) to bundle React, Recharts, and Tailwind locally. This ensures 100% offline availability.
2.  **Implement Sanitization:** Integrate `dompurify` to sanitize HTML content before rendering in Notes, Flashcards, and Journals.
3.  **Add PWA Support:** Add a `manifest.json` and a Service Worker to enable "Add to Home Screen" and asset caching.
4.  **Add Error Boundaries:** Wrap widget components in Error Boundaries to prevent the entire dashboard from crashing if one widget fails (e.g., malformed localStorage data).
5.  **Optimize Images:** While `utils/db.ts` has basic compression, large image wallpapers stored in IndexedDB may impact performance. Implement lazy loading for gallery views.
